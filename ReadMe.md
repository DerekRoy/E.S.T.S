&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a demo developed using an emotion detector from [Pyimagesearch](www.pyimagesearch.com), and [Watson Studio](www.ibm.com/Watson/Studio) speech to text, translation, and sentiment analysis. This repository contains the project skeleton with the emotion detector, and the watson keys removed. The read me file will explain how to set up watson, and where to learn about the emotion detector.
